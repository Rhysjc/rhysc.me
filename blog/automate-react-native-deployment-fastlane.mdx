import { BlogNote } from '../src/components/BlogNote';

This is the process I use to deploy [Stryde](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stryde-workout-planner/id1640276342). Eventually I'll set things up so this runs on a merge to the `main` branch on GitHub, but for now I just do it locally.

Also worth pointing out that I'm only going to cover iOS here, I'll likely post again if/when I release an Android version of Stryde.

## Before you start
You should follow [Fastlane's guide](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/) on getting your environment set up.

## Match
Apple has a kind of convoluted system of provisioning profiles and signing certificates. Fastlane has a tool called match which abstracts away some of this complexity, and stores your profiles and certificates encrypted in a GitHub repo.

If you've messed around inside the Apple developer portal and you'd like to clean things up, you can use `match nuke` to do so. This is an optional step, but if you want to do it you'll need to do it separately for each type of certificate/profile. Let's just do the app store certificates for now.
```shell
fastlane match nuke appstore
```

Now everything's tidy, we can set up match
```shell
fastlane match init
```

This will walk you through setting up your GitHub repo to store your certificates and profiles.

After that, we can run match for each kind of profile we'd like to create. I'll just focus on the `appstore` type which is used to deploy apps to the app store.
```shell
fastlane match appstore
```

Once that's done, we can start with Fastlane.

## Fastlane
Add the below at the very top of your Fastfile
```ruby
before_all do
  ensure_git_branch(branch: 'main')
  ensure_git_status_clean
  git_pull
end
```
This basically says to make sure you're on the `main` branch, that you don't have any uncommitted changes, and then to pull down the latest version of the branch from GitHub. If you don't want to use the `main` branch here, you can change it.

Now we'll define our `:ios` platform
```ruby
platform :ios do
end
```
<BlogNote>Don't stress if this syntax is unfamiliar, Fastlane is written in Ruby. I'll include the full Fastfile at the end.</BlogNote>

Now add the below inside that new block.
```ruby
lane :certs do
  match(app_identifier: {APP IDENTIFIER}, type: 'appstore', readonly: true)
end
```
Replace `{APP IDENTIFIER}` with your app's bundle identifier. This code uses match to fetch your app store certificates and profiles from the GitHub repo you set up earlier.

Next, let's add our build lane inside the platform too.  This is the real meat on the bone.
```ruby
private_lane :build do
  app_store_connect_api_key(
    key_id: ...,
    issuer_id: ...,
    key_filepath: ...,
  )

  certs
  increment_build_number(xcodeproj: {XCODE PROJECT})
  build_app(scheme: {APP NAME}, workspace: {WORKSPACE}, configuration: 'Release')
end
```
The `app_store_connect_api_key` bit depends on what Apple authentication method you've decided to use. I'd recommend the [App Store Connect API key method](https://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/) as that's what I've used here. Next we run our `certs` lane, and then increment our build number. Finally we build the app, be sure to set your scheme name and workspace locations.

Finally, all that remains is to put the pieces together
```ruby
lane :distribute do
  build
  pilot
  commit_version_bump(message: "Version bump", xcodeproj: {XCODE PROJECT})
  push_to_git_remote
end
```
This adds a `distribute` lane which runs our `build` lane, pushes the build to the app store with `pilot`, then commits the version bump we did earlier and pushes it to GitHub.

Here's the full code for our Fastfile
```ruby
before_all do
  ensure_git_branch(branch: 'main')
  ensure_git_status_clean
  git_pull
end

platform :ios do
  lane :certs do
    match(app_identifier: {APP IDENTIFIER}, type: 'appstore', readonly: true)
  end

  private_lane :build do
    app_store_connect_api_key(
      key_id: ...,
      issuer_id: ...,
      key_filepath: ...,
    )

    certs
    increment_build_number(xcodeproj: {XCODE PROJECT})
    build_app(scheme: {APP NAME}, workspace: {WORKSPACE}, configuration: 'Release')
  end

  lane :distribute do
    build
    pilot
    commit_version_bump(message: "Version bump", xcodeproj: {XCODE PROJECT})
    push_to_git_remote
  end
end
```

All that remains now is to run Fastlane and build our app!
```shell
fastlane ios distribute
```
