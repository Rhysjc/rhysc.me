title: Adding dark mode to your Tailwind CSS & Gatsby site

Getting this set up perfectly (no FOUC, persistence) was a little bit tedious, so I thought I'd christen the blog with a little tutorial.

## Gatsby setup
I'm using `use-dark-mode` for this which is a pretty simple React hook that handles persisting the user's choice and adding the relevant class to the body. 

```shell
npm install use-dark-mode
```

You'll then also want to use `gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode`, which injects a script in to your page that makes sure the dark mode class is appended to the body before your page renders. This is what stops you having a flash if the user isn't using the default theme.

```shell
npm install gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode
```

Next, you'll add the plugin in to `gatsby-config.js`
```javascript
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode',
  options: {
    classNameDark: 'dark',
  },
}
```

Note that we're overriding the default class name here - by default `use-dark-mode` will add a `dark-mode` class, but this doesn't match up with what Tailwind expects.

## The Tailwind side
Tailwind makes this pretty easy, all you need to do is modify your config to add the below
```javascript
{
  ...,
  darkMode: 'class'
}
```

This tells Tailwind you want to toggle dark mode manually with a class, rather than just applying the user's default.

If you want to change the body's background like I do on this site, you'll want to add this to your global CSS (wherever you add the `@tailwind` stuff)
```css
body {
  @apply bg-zinc-100 px-2 transition-[background-color];
}

body.dark {
  @apply bg-zinc-800;
}
```

## Putting it together in React
I have a `DarkModeToggle` component that (funnily enough) toggles dark mode!

The important bit is this line
```javascript
const { toggle } = useDarkMode(undefined, { classNameDark: 'dark' });
```
which tells `use-dark-mode` to use the system default, and apply the `dark` class to the body when the mode is changed. This has to match up with the class you gave to `gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode` above.

You can then call `toggle` to change the mode whenever you want. This'll be persisted in local storage and you won't have any flashing on first render.
